 * Functionally a book-only Enderchest with an expandable inventory and a scrolling list GUI.  There's a lot of books in
 * FTB now, and you can print Computercraft programs too.  All of those can go in here, linked up to the player name.
 * Books can be added and removed from the Tome at any time, and there's options (alphabetical, times access, custom)
 * to rearrange as you wish.  Disable InvTweaks here if you can, it'd really screw up the sorting thing if this is just
 * an Enderchest with a fancy GUI.
