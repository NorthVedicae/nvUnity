//Project Table that works better than the Forestry one.  A definitive replacement for RP2's table.  Make it bigger and better.  
//Make the saved recipes a list with ^ V X buttons at the side so you can reorder the list.  Then have an autocraft button that 
//will prefer recipes at the top over recipes at the bottom, so you can dump in a bunch of resources and it'll autocraft everything 
//it can according to the ranking system.  Also a Craft All button that will make as much as it possibly can according to the rank 
//system (makes as much of 1 as it can, then makes as much of 2 as it can, then 3, then 4, etc) but only runs it once.  This is 
//an NP issue and will be a bitch to code.  Autocrafting on an upgraded version of the Table to add some sort of progression?
