//Redstone signal without direct contact.  Works similar to the sensor card system.  Emitter must be placed within eight? blocks of the target?
//Set up so that the emitter is a moderate expense and the cards are the main thing.  So, can transmit to any and all blocks in the eight range
//but each one needs a seperate card which gets a colored frequency on a per-emitter basis.  Maybe need a Diamond, some Redstone Blocks, and
//Sekin Ingots to make four cards or something like that.
