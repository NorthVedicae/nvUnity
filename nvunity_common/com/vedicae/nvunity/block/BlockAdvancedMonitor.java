/* 
 * Wearable like a pumpkin to give a readout of several thingies.  Useful UI upgrade as a trade-off for losing your helmet slot.
 * Make it function like a Halo-style HUD Radar when in block form?  Make the wearable item a Mass Effect styled Visor?
 * 
 * Crafting recipe includes the components used.  So, compass, clock, and more.
 * Direction, XZ Y location, XZ Y Distance targeted block/entity and a crosshair to lead it for bows (that will adjust
 * itself for mod projectiles).  Works with anything, so even like fishing hooks and stuff.  A fancy slope graphic like
 * you find on range finders too.  Clock, next sunrise time, next sunset time, biome, biome temp and humidity, little icons
 * showing what resources are available at your Y-Level and in your biome (for special things restricted by biome) sorted into
 * common in the top row and rare in the bottom row with more common on the left and rarer on the right.  You know what I mean.
 * Slime chunks, Witch spawnable area, everything like that all set up as an awesome HUD.  
 * 
 * That's really overpowered, so maybe have several tiers that need to be upgraded to balance out how awesome it is.  Split
 * the features among each upgrade by usefulness.  Maybe make them rely on a power system at higher levels or on more 
 * powerful modes.  Can take from IC2 gear, Powersuits, or my crystalized energy / liquid ether cells (returns the cell)?  
 * 
 * Have a keybind that cycles through the visor modes.  No overlay, simple, combat, mining, complex/full? modes.
