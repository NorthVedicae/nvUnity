/*
 * The low-end power option.  Absorbs at a 1:1 ratio from the chunk.  Eight can work in one chunk, the nineth won't
 * do anything.  Vibrating graphic or a glow or something to show that it's active.  Must be placed against a block
 * to power it.  The lower tier is cheap but can only absorb and output one energy.  Higher tiers are a small resource
 * bump but still a minor cost.  The main power system will be the pillars and towers and a nexus to set them up, and the
 * really high-end version will be the magistrate section.  The forks may be able to do low-end liquid ether generation
 * really really slowly when connected to a pipe, to harvest it without requiring a Condenser + TE Magma Crucible or an
 * Unconstitutor, but those would have to be done in bulk and they'd be complete shit in the first tier since you could
 * only have eight in a chunk.  When connected to a machine that can use dBu it'll disable the liquid generation part and
 * just supply power to the machine.
 * 
 * Maybe have some sort of distributor that lets you power all connected machines so that you can still get the Grower
 * cubes to function.  Vibration Amplifier?
