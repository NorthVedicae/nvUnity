//A small 1x3x1 multiblock pillar thing that removes the half-energy penalty from pulling energy from adjacent chunks.  Works well when 
//combined with the harvesting towers.  16+16+16+16+16 = 80 energy?  Or maybe make it so only half can transmit at all, putting
//it to 16+8+8+8+8 = 48?  Harvesting tower doesn't remove the penalty, but does receive flow from these pillars.
