package com.vedicae.nvunity.block;

/* 
 * The basic material creation block.  Functions like a furnace, though I'll need to code my own.  Consumes dye and time
 * to produce magically-enhanced ingots.  Works slowly, but faster than the Condenser
 * 
 * Catavall (Sturdy) is any strong building material, like Iron, Bronze, Steel, etc.  Anavall (Dense) is any really heavy
 * material, like Lead, Uranium, Iridium, etc.  Sekin (Delicate) is for precious metals and electrical stuffs, so Silver,
 * Platinum, Electrum, etc.  Maybe include a Diamond > Sekin recipe since they found out it's some kind of superconductor
 * recently.  Make that one a generous output but extra-long time to produce.
 * 
 * Also include the ability to make Bronze and Invar and Electrum and such in here to provide
 * an alternative to the Alloy Furnace or dust combining.
