 * Since I'm making a custom redstone thing I might as well do this.  Redstone laser emitter.  Goes up to 256? blocks
 * in a straight line, not emitting through the laser's path, then where it contacts an item it emits the signal.  
 * Fancy line graphic for Overworld and Nether, no graphic for End since it's space.  Will maintain signal strength.
