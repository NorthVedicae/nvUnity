/*
 * Three ranks:  
 *      Default is just the altar with access to a 7x7 rune and the talent tree selector
 *      Midrank is upgraded with a Focusing Iris or whatever and has an 11x11 rune, the tree selector, the talents, and
 *          access to the Conduit blocks.
 *      Maxrank is upgraded with a better Iris (Nether Star/s likely.  Mind's Eye?), has the 11x11 rune, tree selector, 
 *          talents, an ultimate talent in each tree, the conduit blocks, and a portal to your 16x16x16 personal world.
 *          Maybe 8x8x8.  Not the kind of thing you can build major creations in but enough for some chests or armor
 *          stands or something.  Has an unbreakable Maxrank Altar in the center for returning to where you were when
 *          you came in.  Everything outside of the altar and a small pedastal that it sits on are flat black, like
 *          the subworlds in Dimensional Doors.  The personal world is set up on a per-person basis with some style 
 *          randomizations that are based off your name and maybe the world name.
