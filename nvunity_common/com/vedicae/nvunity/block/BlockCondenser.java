/* 
 * A slow power-sink that makes or enhances items.  So far it just needs to condense dBu into Psionic Spikes, but more
 * features should be added.  Maybe have it store dBu as crystals that can be dumped back into an Unconstitutor later
 * for a decent conversion rate.  Items this block makes should either be cheap or free, the main component here is 
 * time.  Items chosen from a list, one or two only show up later or on certain conditions.  One can only be produced
 * at night, one in the day, a couple that's only after you've made an item past a certain tech level, and so on.
