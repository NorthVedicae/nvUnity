/*  
 * Consumes blocks and items EE2-style to produce energy.  One point of energy consumed provides one dBu for one tick, or 
 * something like that.  An alternative to a large Harvesting Tower network if you want a megabuild or something, but you 
 * need to have a TON of stuff to use as fuel.  Set up some sort of adapter block that'll connect it to networks or just
 * emit it into a chunk with a speaker or something, though a Nexus would handle it with less power loss.
 * Can chunks get overloaded with power?  Negative effects would suck but it should probably have a downside.
 * 
 * Also, make the top open like a Cauldron so you can drop in monsters/animals if you want to be evil,
 * or toss in blocks/items if you want to run it in a fancy way.  Lets me put in a fancy render for the item
 * being consumed.
